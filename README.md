##Getting started
My website can be found on my git hub account at https://github.com/chynanana/spring my code can then be pulled and ran on your local machine.

##Prerequisites
To run my code you will need visual studio code and Spring tool suite. I also use Postman to insert information into my databases so if you would like to change anything you will also need to install Postman. 
#Installing VSC 
 You will need to check your machine and download your required version of VSC from https://code.visualstudio.com/download. 
 Once it is downloaded you will need to set up some things VSC offers steps on settingup your machine at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview.
 In regards to runing my code you will just need to get the live server extension so that you can get my server up and running quickly. 
 We now have all the information from my website but when you run this you will still need to run spring to populate the website.
 #Installing Spring tool suite 
 In order to populate my website with information you will need to use STS. Spring provide steps on how to set up sts at https://spring.io/guides/gs/sts/. That is a beginers guide to sts if you are new to the software.
 Otherwise the software can be downloaded at https://spring.io/tools. You will then need to import my project and run as spring boot app. 
 #Installing Postman
 In order to add information to my website you will need to have already installed sts and you will then need to download postman at https://www.postman.com/downloads/. 
 Once installed you will be able to get and post information on my website using my methods that can be found in sts.
